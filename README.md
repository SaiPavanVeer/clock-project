Clock Project

To start this project first create a folder and open that folder in the vs code.
And in this, vs code creates index.html file, style.css, and app.js.and then links these files to index.html file.
Now go to the body and create a div class name clock in this div I will 15div and their class name will be 1 to 12 numbers and in between divs the same 1 to 12 numbers.
And other their divs will be the data hour hand class name hand hour and date minute hand class name is hand minute and data second-hand class name is hand second. 
And this is the HTML page. These HTML components are styled in style.css.
Now in this, I will add the universal tag and for the after, and before I will add styles for this border-box and font family.
Now I will add the styles to the body I will add display and properties to it and background color.
In this, I will add the color and border radius, width and height, and position.  
In I will place the number in the clock so I used to position and its properties.
And after this, all the numbers will be in the same position to rotate the number I used the transform. 
Now I will add rotation angles to every number. So everyone will be separated and will be in their place. 
This will add the position and properties for the hands. So the hands of the clock will be in the center.  
In this, I will style the center bob of the clock in using the background color, width and height, and position and its properties.
In this, I will style the hour's hand and seconds hand and minutes hand I  using the width and height and background color to it.
And I added all styles and now I will give functionality to it.
I have fixed the set interval of 1000mile seconds for the set clock I gave a function for the set clock.
so it will be calculated the seconds with 60 and minutes with seconds and 60 and hours with minutes and 12. 
I set rotation for the hand and I imported the hour's hand and seconds hand and minute hand to give a function to it.
